            <div class="row text-faded mx-auto">
              <p> During the 2018 summer, I took COGS 187A on Usability and Information Architecture, where I was given a task to form a team with other students and design an app for the elderly population. We began the course by designing a logo to represent our team, which is displayed above the title.</p>
              <p> Our first task was to figure out what kind of app we would be designing, so we started out with a series of user testing and interviews to generate personas and storyboards to represent the population we were designing for. We realized several problems that affected the elderly population in general, including loneliness, health and mental complications, lack of technological comfort and usage, and a rapidly growing generational gap. We then focused in on a couple specific issues to tackle, recognizing that it would be nearly impossible for a single app to effectively combat these problems. This resulted in converging on a central idea to bridge the generational gap while helping the elderly in running errands, namely grocery shopping.</p>

            <p>Wireframe/Prototype</p>
            <div class="row text-faded mx-auto">
              <p> Our next step in the design phase was to begin prototyping and wireframing this idea into a concrete possibility of an app. We used several individually created paper prototypes to demonstrate basic app functionality and design, but many were not focused enough on the overarching need that we were trying to satisfy, nor had the functionality and content we wanted in our app. After significant redesign and analysis as a team, we put together a prototype cooperatively on a chalkboard. This “chalkboard prototype” was then put onto a wireframing program called Figma.</p>
              <p> Our Figma prototype allowed us to add some interactivity and design elements to the prototype that prompted additional user testing to determine if certain features were able to be understood, such as a multiple selection checkbox, or what color schemes or button shapes would be too striking or big for our target population. Below is an example of some of the screens developed during the prototyping phase.</p>

            <p>High-Fidelity Prototype/Future Direction</p>
            <div class="row text-faded mx-auto">
              <p> In the last week of the 5 week course, we put together a working high-fidelity prototype that had many design elements and features we wanted to implement in our final version of our app, which we named “Shoperone”.</p>
              <p> Our main features include connecting seniors citizens with volunteers that accompany them throughout their entire shopping experience, from the time they step out the door, to shopping in store, to returning home safely. The app architecture consists of 2 different sides of the app; 1 for volunteers, 1 for seniors. The senior side is designed with simplicity and speed in mind to allow elderly using the app to navigate through as quickly and efficiently as possible without getting lost in the app. The volunteer side is oriented towards the younger generation, being more complex to navigate, yet adding significantly more functionality and options. An additional incentive for volunteers is the ability to reward and track volunteering hours, which is in particular demand during the high school years. This gives seniors using the app a better, more wholesome shopping experience by connecting them with younger volunteers, increasing activity by encouraging elderly to go out and run errands, and providing safety in the form of an on demand assistant.</p>
              <p> Due to time constraints, my team and I were not able to take the app to the final form of a working app. However, if there was more time and/or funding, I would have liked to conduct further user testing of the high-fidelity prototype and continue to add features such as other errands and functionality to the app in the public release version.</p>

            <div class="row text-faded mx-auto">
              <p> In the spring quarter of 2018, my professor raised an interesting perspective and question on the impact of technology on our daily lives with regard to the nature of when these digital technologies fail us. In particular, the idea that despite today’s digital inundation of technology, there was very little research and information regarding how and where breakdowns of technology affect our daily lives. This topic intrigued me, and I wanted to explore this area of interest in further detail. </p>
              <p> I assembled a team of other students in the class who were also interested in this topic. We decided on a data-based approach, and chose to conduct a self-recorded gathering of all breakdown events in our daily lives for a period of 1 week, coded in specific points of interest, such as time, frequency, device, severity, response-related information, etc. Our data was then combined with data from other groups that were researching similar perspectives of the data. </p>

            <p>Data Analysis</p>
            <div class="row text-faded mx-auto">
              <p> Armed with a sizable amount of data, we began analysis of the data, utilizing various charts, graphs, and other data visualizations to determine the nature of breakdown events. We determined a general focus of examining different levels within the digital hierarchy, ranging from hardware, software, and application level. We then focused in on 3 major categories of analysis: 1) Uniqueness and repeatability of breakdowns per level in the digital hierarchy; 2) Ways breakdowns were solved in each level; and 3) Severity of breakdowns per level. These categories allowed us to generate a broad data-based perspective on the nature of breakdowns for every level of abstraction.</p>

            <p>Results/Conclusions</p>
            <div class="row text-faded mx-auto">
              <p> The information gathered from the analysis enabled us to find results and draw conclusions based on the data. Among many correlations found, we found that software-related breakdowns seemed to have the lowest recurrences as well as overall number of distinct breakdowns, as compared to hardware and application level breakdowns. Furthermore, the trend of breakdown resolutions were distinct in each level of abstraction, but there were several poignant trends that appeared in the data; in hardware breakdowns, a majority of breakdown events were solved by restarting the device; and in software breakdowns, solutions were derived from alternative technologies rather than fixing the breakdown itself. In terms of severity, there was a trend of software issues being rated more severe on average versus hardware issues or application issues.  </p>
              <p> Given these results, we drew some conclusions as to the reason for these trends to occur. One of these examines the reason why software issues are typically rated as more severe being due to most problems involving software issues are unable to be solved directly, which results in frustration of the problem. The results and conclusion from this project supported making technology robust as computer scientist David Ackley argued, as compared to efficiency focused technological design. Limiting breakdowns and designing technology with a heavier emphasis on reliability would drastically improve our day to day life. </p>

              <p> During Fall 2017, I took a course called MAE 8, MATLAB Programming for Engineering Analysis. For my final project in the course, I was tasked with creating a 3D graphical representation of the trajectory of a basketball as it travels through the air, given starting coordinates, initial velocity of the ball, mass, initial force and angles, and rotational velocities, as well as court dimensions. I would then have to perform calculations on the balls and trajectories, including potential and kinetic energy, when they would be equal, their min/max, time, height, landing position and speed, distance, etc. All this information would then be printed out onto a text file.</p>

            <div class="row text-faded mx-auto">
              <p> In my MATLAB code files, I read each ball’s starting information from the text file and processed the data read into usable information. Then I calculated the trajectory of the ball using a series of formulas, checking against the court matrix information to determine when to stop calculating the position of the ball (i.e. when the ball hits a wall/court/hoop). In the next step, I graphed the trajectories onto the court as well as the potential/kinetic energy graphs over time. Finally, I ran each ball through several functions to find additional information about each ball, namely time, max height, landing position, landing speed, and travel distance, then printed this out onto a text file. This project solidified my understanding, ability, and familiarity to use MATLAB to accomplish a multitude of goals and scenarios.</p>
