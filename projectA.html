            <p>Design Process/Storyboarding</p>
            <div class="row mx-auto">
              <p> During the 2018 summer, I took COGS 187A on Usability and Information Architecture, where I was given a task to form a team with other students and design an app for the elderly population. We began the course by designing a logo to represent our team, which is displayed above the title.</p>
              <p> Our first task was to figure out what kind of app we would be designing, so we started out with a series of user testing and interviews to generate personas and storyboards to represent the population we were designing for. We realized several problems that affected the elderly population in general, including loneliness, health and mental complications, lack of technological comfort and usage, and a rapidly growing generational gap. We then focused in on a couple specific issues to tackle, recognizing that it would be nearly impossible for a single app to effectively combat these problems. This resulted in converging on a central idea to bridge the generational gap while helping the elderly in running errands, namely grocery shopping.</p>

            <p>Wireframe/Prototype</p>
            <div class="row mx-auto">
              <p> Our next step in the design phase was to begin prototyping and wireframing this idea into a concrete possibility of an app. We used several individually created paper prototypes to demonstrate basic app functionality and design, but many were not focused enough on the overarching need that we were trying to satisfy, nor had the functionality and content we wanted in our app. After significant redesign and analysis as a team, we put together a prototype cooperatively on a chalkboard. This “chalkboard prototype” was then put onto a wireframing program called Figma.</p>
              <p> Our Figma prototype allowed us to add some interactivity and design elements to the prototype that prompted additional user testing to determine if certain features were able to be understood, such as a multiple selection checkbox, or what color schemes or button shapes would be too striking or big for our target population. Below is an example of some of the screens developed during the prototyping phase.</p>

            <p>High-Fidelity Prototype/Future Direction</p>
            <div class="row mx-auto">
              <p> In the last week of the 5 week course, we put together a working high-fidelity prototype that had many design elements and features we wanted to implement in our final version of our app, which we named “Shoperone”.</p>
              <p> Our main features include connecting seniors citizens with volunteers that accompany them throughout their entire shopping experience, from the time they step out the door, to shopping in store, to returning home safely. The app architecture consists of 2 different sides of the app; 1 for volunteers, 1 for seniors. The senior side is designed with simplicity and speed in mind to allow elderly using the app to navigate through as quickly and efficiently as possible without getting lost in the app. The volunteer side is oriented towards the younger generation, being more complex to navigate, yet adding significantly more functionality and options. An additional incentive for volunteers is the ability to reward and track volunteering hours, which is in particular demand during the high school years. This gives seniors using the app a better, more wholesome shopping experience by connecting them with younger volunteers, increasing activity by encouraging elderly to go out and run errands, and providing safety in the form of an on demand assistant.</p>
              <p> Due to time constraints, my team and I were not able to take the app to the final form of a working app. However, if there was more time and/or funding, I would have liked to conduct further user testing of the high-fidelity prototype and continue to add features such as other errands and functionality to the app in the public release version.</p>
